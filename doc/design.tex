\section{Design Space}

STM design space consists of many axes. Some of them are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Contention management.
\item Conflict detection.
\item Ownership record table configuration (size of the table, size of the single lock
stripe).
\item Memory management approach (laziness allowed).
\item Various timeouts.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Workload (Transaction) characteristics}

Workloads and single transactions can be characterized according to following axes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Transaction size.
\item Read ratio (special case---read-only transaction).
\item Dominant abort reason (write/write conflicts, validation failure during reads and
writes and validation failure during commit).
\item Relative abort time (close to start, close to end, commit-time etc.).
\item Ratio of transactional operations.
\item Contention transactions see.
\end{enumerate}
